# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

## People
<!--
Who needs to be involved, what's the proposed structure, what will it take to get their involvement?
-->

I would like to get the feedback of ROpenSci early. I'll bring them on right away if I know I'll have dedicated tie to work on the project. As mentioned, I would also appreciate the help of the ISC to get other reviewers.

## Processes
<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

Weekly/biweekly meetings with the ISC would be useful. 

## Tools & Tech
<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project? 

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
-->

All set here. I am already paying for [probaverse.com](https://probaverse.com), and will move the package websites under that domain.I am using GitHub for development.

## Funding
<!-- 
[TO DO] THE GUIDANCE IS PRETTY UNCLEAR, ESP IN LIGHT OF GABOR'S PROPOSAL VS AWARD SIZE

-->

I'm asking for \$15,050 CAD. That will cover 10 hours of work per week for 7 weeks, at \$215 per hour.


## Summary
<!--
A summary of the requirements that contextualises the costs
-->

There are two areas where help from the ISC would be great.

1. A lack of breathing room has also meant that the probaverse has been sheltered from the wider community since its inception in early 2020. I would appreciate help in _getting_ help from others and broadcasting the probaverse to the wider community.

2. Ultimately I need to be able to set aside time to work on this project. I hardly have "free time" as a working dad, either. With a financial contribution from the ISC, I will go on reduced hours at work to get this project done.
