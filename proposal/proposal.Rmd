From the Problem Definition above, we established that this project will focus on refactoring the distribution object in the **distionary** package. 

Some goals of the design are outlined in the examples below.

- Should be able to make a basic distribution family:

```
# Make the distribution family
d <- distribution(
  .density = \(x) ifelse(x < 0, 0, exp(-x / mu) / mu),
  .mean = mu,
  ## Named arguments:
  .name = "Exponential",
  .vtype = continuous(),
  .params = params(mu, mu > 0)  # Parameter space can be specified, too.
)

# Should be able to save the distribution (e.g., as a model result)
readr::write_rds(d, "useful_distribution.rds")

# Resolve to a specific distribution; perhaps also evaluate the cdf:
resolve_params(d, mu = 1) |>
  eval_cdf(at = 1:3)
#> [1] 0.6321206 0.8646647 0.9502129
```

- Should be able to include more complex chains of variable dependencies:

```
distribution(
  g = 9.81,
  a = \(s, t) some_complicated function,
  b = \(s, t) another_complicated_function,
  .density = \(x) a(x, x - theta) * b(x + theta, x) / g,
  .mean = theta^2 / g,
  ## Named arguments:
  .vtype = continuous(),
  .params = params(theta)
)
```

- Wrappers will exist for common distribution families, and subfamilies can be created.

```
# Resolves to a Gamma distribution; perhaps also enframe the quantile function
dst_gamma(shape = 1, rate = 2) |>
    enframe_quantile(at = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
#> # A tibble: 3 Ã— 2
#>    .arg quantile
#>   <dbl>    <dbl>
#> 1  0.25    0.144
#> 2  0.5     0.347
#> 3  0.75    0.693

# Resolves to the Exponential family with parameter `rate`:
dst_gamma(shape = 1)
```

Through an iterative design process, I have come up with the following design for the distribution object. More design iterations are likely needed.

- A distribution object contains a "distribution environment" containing properties and function definitions related to the distribution (e.g., the distribution mean, density function, or cumulative distribution function). The environment is like the namespace of a mini R package, and like a namespace, will be locked (for immutability). By default, it goes below the caller environment. 
- Although any object can be made in the distribution environment, special named objects will be accessed by evaluation functions like `eval_density()` (looks for `.density` object) and `mean()` (looks for `.mean` object). 
- Distribution parameters (like the mean and variance of the Normal distribution) might not be resolved to specific values. Once resolved, objects in the distribution environment can also be resolved.
  - Lazy or active bindings sound like appealing options for the initial definition of the distribution environment, or leaving them as expressions and evaluating in a parameter data mask, but issues arise with the order in which properties are accessed.
  - Lists sound like a temptingly simple alternative to environments, but issues arise from a lack of care on the functions' enclosing environments.
  - More realistically, instead of trying to create an environment with unresolved parameters, an "environment generator" can be created consisting of expressions or quosures that can resolve to a new environment every time parameters are resolved.

Feedback on the design from ROpenSci will be sought, along with conversations with the ISC.

A minimum viable product includes sufficient improvements to the existing **distionary** package so as to submit to CRAN. A simpler design can be permitted in case not all the goals (listed in the previous section) are achieved.
