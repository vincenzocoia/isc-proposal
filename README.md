# ISC Proposal: distionary

an overview of the proposal....

## Making your proposal
This is a boilerplate repository that you will need to fork, title appropriately and start filling in.

- Start completing the relevant Rmd pages of the proposal
- Use `ghgenerate.R` to build the document
- Regularly commit and push the changes to github
- Solicit feedback and contributions from others

### Automatically generate your proposal
You can configure this to produce the needed documents and publish them to the github.io for browsing and posterity. This assumes a reasonable amount of comfort with using Travis-CI but if you're not, please check out my [post on auto-deploying documents](http://itsalocke.com/automated-documentation-hosting-on-github-via-travis-ci/) for background.

- Turn on [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org) for the repository
- Add an environment variable called GH_TOKEN to the travis environment, set the value to an OAuth key generated by github to allow "public repo" privileges only
- Amend the `.push_gh_pages.sh` and `ghgenerate.R` with the details of your repository and preferred commit details
- Use the gh-pages branch to host your proposal online and to retrieve the HTML or PDF variants for emailing
